--------------------------------------------------

This tool aims to implement various DLL injection techniques
that work across multiple Windows versions. The user defines
a DLL, a process ID, and technique and the tool attempts to
inject the DLL into the process and execute it. 

This was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

It currently supports the following methods:

	1. CreateRemoteThread()
		
	2. NtCreateThreadEx()
		The following sites were used as a reference when implementing 
		this method:
